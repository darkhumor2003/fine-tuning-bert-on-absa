# Fine-Tuning-Bert-on-ABSA
In this project I have fine-tuned BERT on SemEval 2014 Task 4 dataset so it can work on ABSA and in the end I have deployed the model.

I have attached the .ipynb file in this project and a saved model of this project so you can integrate it with streamlit or any other library to deploy it. I have also attached the streamlit source code file.
